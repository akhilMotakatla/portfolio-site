      <p>
        Hey! I’m a versatile Software Engineer with 5+ years rocking .NET, C#, ASP.NET Core, and Azure 🌐. 
        Just finished my Master’s in Computer Science at the University of North Texas (yep, I was also a Graduate Teaching Fellow — teaching is my jam! 🎓👨‍🏫).
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m all about building cool, scalable web apps, cloud-native stuff ☁️, and automating data pipelines like a pro 🤖. 
        I dabble in SQL, Python, and squeezing out every bit of performance 🚀. 
        Plus, I’m pretty good at explaining tech stuff without putting people to sleep 😴 and mentoring others along the way.
        Right now, I’m on the hunt for Software Developer or Data Engineer gigs where I can contribute, learn, and maybe crack a few bad coding jokes along the way 😄💻.
